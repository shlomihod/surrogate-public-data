### GEM implementation

This is a lightly modified implementation of "Iterative methods for private synthetic data: Unifying framework and new methods." by Liu, Terrance, Giuseppe Vietri, and Steven Z. Wu. The original implementation can be found at 'https://github.com/terranceliu/dp-query-release/tree/main/src' (which, to the best of our knowledge, is stale).
